# What is this?
A SolidWorks doodle. I was looking at a pair of Visegrips, and thought the linkage would be kinda cool to replicate.

It requires a spring of appropriate length, and some hardware for pivots. Changing the design for different sized hardware and springs should be trivial.


I never ended up laser cutting this.
