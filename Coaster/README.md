# What is this?

Some jerk stole my coaster off my desk! Why would they do that?
I couldn't find a replacement I liked, so this is a design for a coaster. You know, for mugs and stuff.

I arched the tail to make it the dinosaur fit in a square box. Should be cut at 10x10cm.

The current idea is to etch the body.png on some wood, and then etch the skeleton on some acrylic, and laminate the two together somehow.
There will be some playing around with that plan to see what looks cool.

Outline.svg / outline.dxf has the 10x10cm outline with rounded corners for actual cutting.
