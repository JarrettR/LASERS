These are all of the DXFs required. "Sidecap" is an object to hold the assembly square, but I don't believe it is necessary in the latest revision, and can be left off.

"Side" and "retainer" should be cut twice for each shelf.

These particular files are for 3mm material, and M3 screws (13 - 16mm long). See below for using different materials.

A 3D version of this project, that should also be editable, is available through Autodesk, here:

This is the "small vial" size, fitting the orange-capped 1.5mL plastic test tubes found on AliExpress for very very cheap.

If you need different sizes, download Fusion 360 (it's free!) and edit the above file. Change only _five variables_ to adjust the assembly for different test tube sizes.

- vial_height, vial_diameter, vial_lidheight, vial_lidDiameter, and shelf_numVials

(You'll need to select the component->body command in the histogram and rebuild that step, too)

There are also other variables to change everything from material thicknesses, hardware sizes, shelf length, and tilt angle - literally every single value is done through parameters. Go nuts!
