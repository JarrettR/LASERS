# What is this?
Originally to run the z-axis of my EDm, this is a 28byj-48 stepper motor based CNC axis.

I've since changed the design parameters of the EDM, but this is still a good general solution that might come in handy.

Requires the above stepper, some ground rod cut to size, and a whole lot of acrylic.
In the future, it would be a good idea to include bronze bushings for the linear rod.
