# What is this?

I impulse-purchased a lot of 58 little nylon gears.

It was like, two bucks. It's a good variety, which gives me flexibility to design something cool out of them.


This is an attempt to do that.

The design has a mount for a standard small DC motor, and has a gear ratio of 1000:3.7

If this works well, I'll probably design a more compact drivetrain. The components here are about twenty cents! And if it works out, you can buy bulk orders of exactly the gears you need.
