This is an extremely simple arm based off a common articulated lamp design.

See "images" folder for the concept.


Individual struts can be laser cut.
A few layers for each strut laminated together for strength, if necessary.

Replacing the springs on the outside is one piece of twine on the inside, looped around the upper spacer.

This is connected to a custom head on a DC motor.


The motor spins one way, twine twists up and gets shorter. It's a simple and cheap linear actuator design with almost no repeatability.


And optoencoder and LED shine through a hole on the motor head to count approximate travel.

A pull-type solenoid retracts during the spin-up, then gets de-energized afterwards and gets caught on the spikes to hold in position.


Current status:
The head has been 3D printed and fitted onto a DC motor. String (yarn, actually) has been tied to it and the motor spun up. This seems to generate pulling force as expected, but I have not stress-tested this.
Laser cutter files or 3D printed spacers have not been made.
